## vt iocstream

Manage IoC Stream notifications

```
vt iocstream [notification_id]... [flags]
```

### Examples

```
## List:
# List notifications from a hunting rule by name
vt iocstream list -f "origin:hunting tag:my_rule"
# List notifications from a hunting ruleset by name
vt iocstream list -f "origin:hunting tag:myRuleset"
# List just the entity IDs of your IoC Stream matches
vt iocstream list -I
# List ALL the entity IDs in your IoC Stream and store them in a csv file (this might take a while)
vt iocstream list -I â€“limit 9999999 > results.csv
# List the first IoC Stream notifications including the hash, last_analysis_stats, size and file type
vt iocstream list -i "_id,last_analysis_stats,size,type_tag"
# Check if a hash is in your IoC Stream matches
vt iocstream list -f "entity_type:file entity_id:hash"

## Delete:
# Delete all notifications matching a filter, e.g. all matches for a Yara rule/ruleset. This process is
# asynchronous, so it can take a while to see all the notifications deleted.
vt iocstream delete -f "origin:hunting tag:my_rule"
# Delete a single notification with ID 1234568. The notification ID is displayed in the context_attributes.
vt iocstream delete 1234568
