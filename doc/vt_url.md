## vt url

Get information about URLs

### Synopsis

Get information about one or more URLs.

This command receives one or more URLs and returns information about them. URL
hashes as returned in the "object_id" field are also accepted. The information
about each URL is returned in the same order as the URLs are passed to the
command.

If the command receives a single hypen (-) the URLs are read from the standard
input, one per line.
